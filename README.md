# Get started
<h2 id="description">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The library is simple, like every other calendar library you might have seen, but geared towards representing
talents' public appearances with the various options.
</p>
<p>There is a very self-explanatory calendar layout on the left, and on the right is an <em>"event panel"</em>,
where it either shows the events on the day the user selected <em>(try clicking on the days!)</em>, or the upcoming
5 appearances at the time being, including today.
</p>
<p>
To get started, include the stylesheet <code>tcal-styles.css</code>, script of library <code>tcal-library.js</code> and <code>JQuery</code> in your webpage.
